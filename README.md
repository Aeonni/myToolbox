# myToolbox

MyToolbox is a repository to store those scripts I wrote for my daily needs. These scripts may save your time if you have the same demands.

There is three parts in this repo:

1. Handy
   - Scripts in this folder is light and simple, you can directly execute them if you install the basic environment.

2. Advanced
   - These scripts may have more dependencies or need some adjustments, due to the differences between platforms and your specific needs.
   - You need to manualy install those dependencies you are missing. Some installation may be tricky, but I'm sure you can do it! 

3. Archived
   - This folder contains scripts that are out of date or maybe bugged. 
   - You will waste a lot of time debugging if you want to use them. 
   - Although those codes are out of date, you may inspired from it if you are writing a similar script.

**All the scripts are not well-explained since they are written for my personal usage.**

**Explore it by yourself!**

**Best wishes!**
